# About

Hello! I'm Jim.
This site exists because of independent bloggers I've been reading for years.
All of them ran their own small websites, wrote at their own pace, and did not seem to care too much about algorithms or growth charts.
After a while, I realised I wanted the same thing. So this is my website.

I am based out of Amsterdam. I'm still in uni but I support myself with tech gigs.
Writing helps me think more clearly about stuff and remember what I learned.
These days I am mostly learning Rust and Python.
Rust for the discipline it forces on you.
Python for its flexibility and how quickly ideas turn into something real.
Here I'll write short TIL-style notes.
