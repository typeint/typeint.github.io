# Static Typing Matters

When I first started programming, I did not think much about types.
If the code ran, that was good enough.
Most beginner-friendly languages let you get away with that.
I started learning programming with Python.
But when I got my first software dev gig, a senior engineer I worked with showed me how to enable type hints in Python.
I was skeptical of its benefits.
I felt ugly putting type hints too at first.
It was like why take a beautiful language like Python and add more noise to it?

But as the project became larger and larger, I changed my mind. Static
typing started to feel less like bureaucracy and more like a safety net.
One underrated benefit of types is that they act as documentation.
When you see a function signature, you immediately know what goes in and what comes out.
This matters even more when you come back to your own code months later.
After seeing the virtues of static typing, I don't think I can go back.
