<p>Hello! I’m Jim. This site exists because of independent bloggers I’ve
been reading for years. All of them ran their own small websites, wrote
at their own pace, and did not seem to care too much about algorithms or
growth charts. After a while, I realised I wanted the same thing. So
this is my website.</p>
<p>I am based out of Amsterdam. I’m still in uni but I support myself
with tech gigs. Writing helps me think more clearly about stuff and
remember what I learned. These days I am mostly learning Rust and
Python. Rust for the discipline it forces on you. Python for its
flexibility and how quickly ideas turn into something real. Here I’ll
write short TIL-style notes.</p>
